# questionnaire
some random questionnaire I made in html for someone.
the html document might not look that great alone, so I would suggest running the html code with the css @_@

update 11/19/2021: not much has changed throught the code itself but the css has been updated a lot, I changed the color of the background for the page, also the name field has been updated quite a little. other then all of this nothing has changed
